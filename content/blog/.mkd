My very first blog post!
---
How exciting, I've always wanted to have a blog, but I didnt want to use something
like blogspot or the like, so I decided to go with something that worked well with
[Wok][]. I looked around and found that [Kevin Ngo's](http://ngokevin.com) set up
was pretty much exactly what I wanted. I borrowed most of his blog
[code](http://github.com/ngokevin/ngokevin/) and basically dropped it in, and it
worked great. I'll probably end up making some changes once I've got some more
content, but for now this is a really well working system.
